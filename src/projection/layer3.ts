/**
 * Layer-3 contracts for `transactions` (Phase 4b of #80 / #91).
 *
 * "Layer 3" in the 3-layer data model (#80) means **user-truth**:
 * fields whose value reflects an explicit user decision, never an
 * extraction output. Re-derive (#89) and re-extract (#91 Phase 4c)
 * MUST NOT overwrite these — doing so destroys work and silently
 * loses information the user expected to be preserved.
 *
 * `places.custom_name` (renamed from `custom_name_zh` in #79) is
 * the canonical Layer-3 example for the `places` table; this module
 * establishes the equivalent for `transactions`. The contract has
 * two flavors:
 *
 * 1. HARD Layer 3 — fields the ingest agent never writes from
 *    extraction. Any non-default value is by definition user-set
 *    (or system state, like the FK chain identity columns). Re-extract
 *    omits these from its UPDATE column list entirely. See
 *    `HARD_LAYER3_TX_FIELDS` below.
 *
 * 2. SOFT Layer 3 — fields the ingest agent DOES write but
 *    `PATCH /v1/transactions/:id` (via `UpdateTransactionRequest`)
 *    lets the user override. These need per-field tracking because
 *    we can't distinguish "agent-written → user-accepted" from
 *    "agent-written → user-overrode" without an explicit flag.
 *    Convention: `transactions.metadata.user_edited.<field> = true`
 *    is set by `updateTransaction` when the user PATCHes that field;
 *    re-extract reads this allowlist via `isFieldUserEdited` and
 *    skips the field on the UPDATE.
 *
 * The wire-up for the SOFT path lives in Phase 4c. This module
 * exports the contract so both `updateTransaction` and the future
 * `reExtractDocument` service read from one source of truth.
 */

/**
 * Transaction columns that re-extract NEVER writes. Mirrors the
 * `places.custom_name` shielding in `src/routes/places.service.ts
 * ::reDerivePlace` — the field is simply absent from the UPDATE
 * column list, not COALESCE-protected. Omission is unconditional.
 *
 * Column names use snake_case (DB names), not camelCase (Drizzle
 * field names). Re-extract's UPDATE is built from these names, so
 * matching the SQL column is the useful contract.
