# Multi-stage build for receipt-assistant.
#
#   builder  — installs full deps (incl. devDependencies), compiles TypeScript,
#              then prunes to production deps.
#   runtime  — minimal image that only contains dist/ + production node_modules
#              + the claude CLI.
#
# Both stages use node:22-bookworm so that native modules compiled in the
# builder stage are ABI-compatible with the runtime stage (same glibc, same
# node ABI).
